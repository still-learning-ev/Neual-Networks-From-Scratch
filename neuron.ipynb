    "# NEURON\n",
    "### **Author**: Zeeshan Ahmad Lone \n",
    "#### **Introduction**: In this module we are going to learn basics of neuron and implement it from scratch using python and numpy.\n",
    "#### **Note**:- This module assumes that reader has basic knowledge of python and numpy and linear algebra.\n",
    "#### A single neuron reprsents a mathematical function that tries to mimic the neuron inspired from neuroscience\n",
    "1. Mathematical representation of the neuron is given as $$y = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_{i} * x_{i} + b$$ Where $$y = \\textit{Output of the neuron}, w = \\textit{Weigths present in the neuron, x = \\textit{Input to the neuron} and b = \\textit{Bias}}$$\n",
    "2. Unrolling the above equation if $n = 3$ we get $$y = w_{0}*x_{0} + w_{1}*x_{1} +w_{2}*x_{2} + b$$\n",
    "Let us understand the meaning of above equation $x$ means inputs that will be given to our neuron and based on the inputs our neuron is going to produce some output $y$ by multiplying each input with some number $w$ called weigths and each input has its own weight and finally adding a term $b$ called bias.$\\newline$ \n",
    "There can be $n$ number of inputs that will be given to our neuron $\\textit{i.e}$ if $n = 2$ which means that our neuron will have two inputs $x_{1}\\space and \\space x_{2}$ and corresponding to the two inputs it will have two weights $w_{1} \\space and \\space w_{2}$ and only one bias term $\\textit{b}$.$\\newline$\n",
    "Similarly, there can be $n$ number of inputs that will be given to our neuron $\\textit{i.e}$ if $n = 3$ which means that our neuron will have two inputs $x_{1}\\space , \\space x_{2} \\space and\\space x_{3}$ and corresponding to the three inputs it will have three weights $w_{1} \\space , \\space w_{2} \\space and \\space w_{3}$ and only one bias term $\\textit{b}$.\n",
    "### We will see the implementation of the neuron in pure python after that we are going to move and implement the same neuron using numpy.\n",
    "- We are going to start by an example\n",
    "- Let us say $n = 4$ which means our neuron will have four inputs $x_{1}\\space , \\space x_{2} \\space , \\space x_{3} \\space ans \\space x_{4}$\n",
    "- If $n = 4$ that means weigths will also be 4 $w_{1} \\space , \\space w_{2} \\space , \\space w_{3} \\space and \\space w_{4}$\n",
    "- Finally we will have a bias term $b$ with some value."

    "## Conclusion and Future Work:\n",
    "- We have understood basic building block of a neural network called neuron.\n",
    "- We have implemented neuron in pure python using variables.\n",
    "- We have implemented neuron in python using lists.\n",
    "- We have understood basics of dot product.\n",
    "- Finally, we have implemented neuron using numpy library and numpy arrays. We have also used numpy to do dot product instead of for loop which makes our code more clean, efficient and makes our life much more easy.\n",
    "- In future we would like to make our code modular and make layer of neurons instead of only a single neuron which will lead us to neural networks.\n",
